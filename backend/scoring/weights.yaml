# Scoring Weights Configuration
# Adjust these to change how business ideas are ranked
# All weights must sum to 1.0 (will be normalized if not)

weights:
  demand_strength: 0.25      # Volume of mentions/signals
  demand_velocity: 0.20      # Growth trend / recency
  competition_proxy: 0.15    # Market saturation (inverse - low comp = high score)
  feasibility: 0.20          # Build complexity and risk
  automation_friendly: 0.10  # Can it run with low oversight
  monetization_clarity: 0.10 # Clear pricing model and willing buyer

# Scoring notes:
# - demand_strength: Raw volume of search results, posts, mentions
# - demand_velocity: Trend direction (growing = higher score)
# - competition_proxy: Estimated saturation based on existing solutions
# - feasibility: How easy to build and operate (lower ops burden = higher)
# - automation_friendly: Can it run mostly hands-off
# - monetization_clarity: Clear path to revenue with defined customer
